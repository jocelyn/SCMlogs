---[ SCMLogs : Overview      ]---

	Quickly, each time a commit is done in the repository
	log.py is called, and put a formated log into a file "commits.txt"
	Then everyday for instance,  %SCMLogs%/bin/email_cvscommits.sh is launched.
	It will :
		- move the file to a better place under a directory year YYYY/ and the filename containing the date
		- send by email the logs in a formatted way (HTML), sorted by modules and date, and filtred according each developper profile.

---[ SCMLogs : Requires      ]---

	Apache + PHP : For the web interface
	Python : for the script
	Crontab : for the schedjuled tasks

	Nota: The web server should be able to view the logs directory of the CVS repository.


---[ SCMLogs : Web Interface ]---
	unzip the archive file into your selected web directory
	for instance /usr/local/apache/htdocs/SCMLogs
	let's alias it in this doc by %SCMLogsDir%

	edit %SCMLogsDir%/config.inc to set the adapted values

	edit the data/all.tpl to include the module you want developper to be able to receive the mcommit logs.

---[ SCMLogs : Cvs log ]---

	add to the CVSROOT/loginfo file, the line:
	DEFAULT /export/cvs/bin/log.py -i %{sVv} -l /export/cvs/logs/commits.txt

---[ SCMLogs : Cvs email sender ]---
	put in a cron, for instance :
		0 21 * * * /usr/local/bin/python /export/cvs/bin/process_cvscommits.py
		0 9 * * * /usr/local/bin/python /export/cvs/bin/process_cvscommits.py

	Before don't forget to edit email_cvscommits.sh and to set the value of the parameters according to your environment.


---[ SCMLogs : Warning ]---

	Quite often the web server and the cvs server are not the same,
    the web application will have to look at the logs directory.
	the logs.py is quite independant and can be use only with cvs.
	the script to send email has to be able to read the logs directory, and akso the data: SCMLogs/data/* files.
	Depending if apache run as user:group nobody:nobody, you will have to make the directory SCMLogs/data writable to nobody, then to everyone ...
	logs/commits.txt should be writable too.
	
	This doc had been made quickly ... so ... if you have any difficulties ... jfiat@djoce.net ...
